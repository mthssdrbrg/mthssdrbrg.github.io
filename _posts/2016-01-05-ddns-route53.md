title: dynamic dns using amazon route53
tags: aws dns route53 shell bash
---

For the past ten months or so I've been using no-ip.com's [Dynamic DNS
service](https://www.noip.com/remote-access) for my home server, and
while it works just fine, it's rather annoying to have to go through a "confirm"
process every 30 days.

Recently I ended up on Will Warren's blog, and more specifically [this post](https://willwarren.com/2014/07/03/roll-dynamic-dns-service-using-amazon-route53/)
and realized that I could do the same as I had moved this blog from GitHub pages
to AWS S3 and in the process also moved over to Route53.

I couldn't resist a little hacking, so I extended Will's script and created a
GitHub repo for it: [ddns-route53](https://github.com/mthssdrbrg/ddns-route53).
While a repo might be a bit overkill (could've just made the script a gist),
I like repos as I usually find them easier to find and I could also add some
light testing (running `shellcheck` on Travis).

Anyhow, If you already have a hosted zone setup using Route53, getting started
is just a few commands away:

```bash
$ curl -sLO https://github.com/mthssdrbrg/ddns-route53/raw/master/ddns-route53
$ chmod +x ddns-route53
$ ./ddns-route53 --zone-id=$YOUR_ZONE_ID --record-set=$YOUR_RECORD_SET
```

It's also possible to specify an explicit IP with the `--ip` flag, which is
convenient for running the script from another machine (I used it from my laptop
during development for example), otherwise it'll look up the IP of your current
machine using OpenDNS.

```bash
$ ./ddns-route53 --zone-id=$YOUR_ZONE_ID --record-set=$YOUR_RECORD_SET --ip=$YOUR_IP
```
